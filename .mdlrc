## notes:
# MD024 https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md#md024---multiple-headers-with-the-same-content
# Since we want to allow for a TOC headers for sub-categories of items
# under a grouping, such as "tools"->"python", "services"->"python" this
# rule is not as applicable. We also use `gh-md-toc` to generate the TOC
# and it should handle the duplication.
